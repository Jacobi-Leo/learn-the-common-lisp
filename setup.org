* How to set up a common lisp programming platform
There are many ways of setting up lisp programming platform, the following discusses some of them.
** LispWorks
 The commercial way of solving problem. Very expensive. Not suitable for me.
** SLIME
 The Emacs way of solving the problem. Very efficient, and if Spacemacs installed, just add the 'common lisp' layer.
 SLIME is not only a front end for the common lisp interpreter (I prefer CLisp and SBCL), but also a whole environment.
 Don't just use SLIME as REPL: you can write the code and run it nearly at the same time with the help of SLIME due to
 the functional nature of lisp.
** Quicklisp
 Package management system for common lisp.
